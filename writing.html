            <p>Example of documentation for a GitHub project.</p>
            <p>Documentation for a project demonstrating JEST. I find that many projects have a lot of assumed knowledge, so I try to be detailed in discussing pre-requsites to getting my code up and running. I recall times when I personally have gone to conferences and was unable to follow along with presenters due to assumed knowledge.</p>            
            <p>If I say "well, it works on my machine" in response to someone struggling to catch up, it means my documentation needs work.</p>
