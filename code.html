                <p>A script I created in Excel to generate my class MySQL schemas, grant permissions, and load data to their schemas.</p>
                <p>I've ported it over to Google Sheets. My goal was to paste my roster and have everything generated for me.<br />
                   This strips the domain from the username, creates an account with the same username (using Windows authentication/single sign on), create a new schema for the user, grant them permissions, and populate it, and give read/execute access to common databases. There are a few other tabs to clean up student accounts at the end of the semester and refresh instructor and tutor accounts.<br />
                   Basically, it's a great way to use Excel's string manipulation. </p>

                <p>A Python script I created to generate random data sets that include diverse names. Textbook databases too often are filled with names like John Smith.</p>
                <p>There are a few data files that go with this that will prevent this from running but you can see my logic!</p>
