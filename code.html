  <h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>
  <p>You have reached the professional portfolio of Eric Cameron</p>
  <p>Below you will find some code samples.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><h2><a href="Granting Database Permissions.xlsx" target="_top">Database Setup</a></h2>
          <p>A script I created in Excel to generate my class schemas, grant permissions, and load data files to their schemas.</p>
          <p>You may ask why I did this in Excel; I found it easier to copy and paste from our database server than to save to a data file.</p>
        </td>
        <td><h2><a href="Generate Dataset.py" target="_top">Generating Diverse Datasets</a></h2>
          <p>A Python script I created to generate random data sets that include diverse names. Textbook databases too often are filled with names like John Smith.</p>
          <p>There are a few data files that go with this that will prevent this from running but you can see my logic!</p>
